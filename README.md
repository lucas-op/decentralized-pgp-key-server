# Decentralized PGP Key Server

## Summary

This project aims to create a decentralized key server for PGP keys using attestations. The goal is to make it easy for users to attest that a public key is valid and display a trust score for that keyâ€™s validity, creating a web of trust model between users and their public keys.

## Features

- **Attestations**: Allow users to easily attest to the validity of a PGP key.
- **Trust Score**: Create a trust score based on attestations between keys.
- **Trust Verification**: Check the trust score for a given key.
